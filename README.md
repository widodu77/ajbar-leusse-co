Dear customer, Habibi's and co is back! 

As you already know we like to base our software on the principal of the call center as it is very easy to use and to understand.

In our zip folder there are six important file. The files named projetQ1,projetQ2,projetQ5 and profile each one of them contains the functions that will be used and called during the call center proces. 

The file name projetQ1 contains:One mother class(Matrix) containing functions related to matrices manipulation and two children classes(DenseMatrix and SparseMatrix) with more specific functions made to manipulate these special functions. 


The file name projetQ2 contains:One mother class(Matrix) containing with functions related to matrices manipulation and two children classes(DenseMatrix and SparseMatrix) with more specific functions made to manipulate these special functions. The catch is that no libraries were used in this file 

The file name projetQ5 contains: The functions related to SVD and binary matrices as well as the recommendations


The file name profile contains: a call of the profile of all the functions implemented in the previous files.

The file name interactive1 is made so that you are going to call the functions you need. We invite you to go to your terminal then do python interactive1.py and then more instructions will be given to you 

The file name interactive2 is made so that you will be able to compare the efficiency of the functions with each others. We invite you to go to your terminal then do python interactive2.py and then more instructions will be given to you.
